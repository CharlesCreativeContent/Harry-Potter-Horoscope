## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

My learning was focused on the manipulation of date objects. A horoscope was the perfect oppurtunity to practice conversion between date types.

## Optimizations

It would have been nice to be able to get a current date function that checks the current date and alters the horoscope output. Not too much optimization needed as (I think) my code was pretty lean, but maybe I will think otherwise in the future.

## Lessons Learned:

Date Object Methods are troublesome. It took a couple tries to get it right and I eventually just used string methods to finish up the app. I would have loved to get all od the Date Object Methods to work how I expected them.
